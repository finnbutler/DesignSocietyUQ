# Design Society UQ Code of Conduct

## 1.0 Society Values and Expectations

The Design Society UQ is a society intended for **all** members of the UQ student body and surrounding community with an interest in design. The society recognises the vast diversity of backgrounds and identities that make up the individuals of its membership; and as such, is **firmly committed** to ensuring the society, in all it's venues (Slack, Events, and other areas of note), is a safe space for its members. In saying this, the society has an expectation upon its members that they will:

- Respect the people within the society; this extends to respecting the unique identities and background diversity that exists within our society. In short, **insults or attacks** on any aspect of a members person is against the values of the society. Discrimination on the basis of gender identity, race, background, religious beliefs, disabilities, and/or sexual orientation are completely disallowed.
- Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content is prohibited within the society; while you are free to send this type of content outside the society, sending NSFW imagery or content in public areas, to individual members without their permissions, is disallowed.
- The society aims to help all members on their design journeys; however, the society is not a place for sustained emotional support. [UQ offers free support services for those in need](https://www.uq.edu.au/student-services/counselling-services), and we encourage anyone who is struggling to reach out.
- Aggressive language or insinuations against members or entities is disallowed; the society is against threats of violence targeted at specific individuals, or groups of people.
- Individuals who harass or otherwise make members feel uncomfortable will be directed to cease immediately upon the issue being raised to the committee; failure to cease these actions will be grounds for removal from the society.
- Members of the society may be employed by the University as demonstrators or course staff for a course you may be undertaking; these members are **not** working in a professional capacity when in a society event or on the society's Slack, and it is an expectation that members will respect the privacy of their tutors, and understand they are **not** required to provide assistance outside of class times. This is not preventing casual discussions with these members unrelated to course work.

This is not a comprehensive list. This code of conduct is an evolving document, and it is expected members and those attending events apply an amount of common sense to their actions; the society aims to provide a safe, engaging community environment, and actions which go against this are considered against the values of the society.

## 2.0 Consequences of Conduct Breach

Every member of the society, and those in attendance to events, are subject to the code of conduct of the society. Failure to adhere to the code of conduct will result in appropriate action being taken, specified below and up to the discretion of the actioning committee:

- Formal warning on behalf of the society, with the expectation of behaviour being ceased.
- Temporary removal from the society; this includes barring from events and the society's Slack community, as well as Facebook discussions. The duration of this removal is up to the discretion of the society.
- Permanent removal from the society; with appeal to the society on a case by case basis, made clear to the offender at the time of their removal.
- Further action (police report, contacting of UQ Security and administration, and similar).

## 3.0 Additional Expectations

Finally, all members of the society, and those in attendance to events are expected to uphold the [UQ Student Code of Conduct PPL's](https://ppl.app.uq.edu.au/content/3.60.04-student-integrity-and-misconduct).
